Structure padding in 16 bit or 32 bit registers and need of structure padding
Returning reference to local variable → dangling reference → undefined behavior.
References do not need dereferencing (*) to access the value; they behave just like the original variable.
References cannot be reseated.
Returning a reference to a local variable causes undefined behavior — you're returning a variable that no longer exists after function ends.
Reference is an alias for a variable. It cannot be NULL and must be initialized.
Pointer is a variable storing address. It can be reassigned and can be NULL.
 In the line "int* a, b;", how many pointers are declared?
Many assume both a and b are pointers, but only a is a pointer — b is just an int.
