Git interview guide — common use cases & commands

Short, practical, and interview-ready notes for git stash, rename branch, git stash apply / pop, plus pitfalls & quick examples.

1) git stash — why & when

Use-case: you’re mid-change, need to switch branch or pull/rebase, but don’t want to commit unfinished work.
What it does: saves working-directory + staged changes (by default) on a stack and reverts working tree to HEAD.

Commands & examples

Save changes:
git stash

Save with message:
git stash push -m "WIP: fix auth bug"

Include untracked files (new files not in index):
git stash push -u -m "WIP + untracked" (-a includes ignored files too)

List stashes:
git stash list

Show stash diff/details:
git stash show stash@{0}
git stash show -p stash@{0} (patch)

Interview tip

Explain that stash is stack-like (LIFO), and each stash is referenced as stash@{0}, stash@{1}, …

2) git stash apply vs git stash pop

Use-case: reapply stashed changes back onto your working tree.

git stash apply [stash@{n}]

Reapplies stash but keeps the stash in the stash list. Good when you want to re-use it or test multiple branches.

git stash pop [stash@{n}]

Reapplies and removes the stash on success. Equivalent to apply + drop.

If conflicts occur when applying/popping: Git will stop and mark conflicts in files — resolve them and git add/git commit as usual.

If pop fails and stash not dropped, it remains — safe. If pop succeeded but files partially merged, stash may be dropped; use git reflog to recover if needed.

Example flow
git stash push -m "WIP login"
git checkout feature/other
git stash apply        # reapply but stash remains
# ... if good:
git stash drop stash@{0}
# or:
git stash pop          # reapply and remove in one step

Helpful commands

Create branch from stash (safer when you want a dedicated branch):
git stash branch my-wip-branch stash@{0}
This creates my-wip-branch from the commit where stash was made and applies stash, then removes it.

Drop a stash explicitly:
git stash drop stash@{2}

Clear all stashes:
git stash clear

3) Rename a branch — local & remote

Use-case: branch name is wrong/typo or you want a clearer name.

Rename local branch (you’re on it)
git branch -m new-name


Or explicitly:

git branch -m old-name new-name

Rename when checked-out on different branch
git branch -m old-name new-name

Update remote to reflect rename

Push new branch and set upstream:

git push origin -u new-name


Delete old remote branch:

git push origin --delete old-name
# or
git push origin :old-name


(On other collaborators' clones) they should fetch and prune:

git fetch origin --prune
git branch -u origin/new-name new-name   # to set tracking

If you must force-update remote (be careful)

If remote history diverged or you intentionally rewrite, you might need git push --force-with-lease — prefer --force-with-lease over --force to avoid clobbering others' work.

Interview tip

Mention communicating branch renames to team and updating CI pipelines that reference old branch names.

4) Common real-world scenarios (mini-cases)

Quick fix, then revert: git stash && git checkout master && git pull && git checkout - && git stash pop

Pull with local WIP: git stash push -m "WIP" && git pull --rebase && git stash pop

Try WIP on a different branch without removing stash: git stash apply stash@{0} then later git stash pop or keep it for reuse.

Recover lost changes: if you accidentally drop and need recovery, try git reflog to find stash commit-ish and git fsck --lost-found (advanced).

5) Pitfalls & best practices (good interview talking points)

Untracked files: git stash by default does NOT stash untracked files. Use -u if you want them included.

Stash conflicts: treat like merge conflicts — resolve, git add, and commit.

Stash is not a backup — avoid relying on stash for long-term storage; commit to a WIP branch if change is important.

Renaming remote branch can break CI/deploy hooks — always inform team and update references.

git stash pop removes stash only on success — if merge conflicts occur, stash might still be present (safer), but verify with git stash list.

Multiple stashes — always annotate with -m so team members can recognize them.

6) Short cheat-sheet (commands)
# stash
git stash                      # save changes
git stash push -m "msg" -u     # stash + untracked
git stash list                 # list
git stash show -p stash@{0}    # view patch
git stash apply stash@{0}      # reapply (keep stash)
git stash pop stash@{0}        # reapply and remove
git stash branch name stash@{0}# create branch from stash and apply

# rename branch
git branch -m old new          # rename local
git push origin -u new         # push new remote and set upstream
git push origin --delete old   # remove old remote branch

# housekeeping
git stash drop stash@{0}
git stash clear

7) Short mock-interview Qs you can expect (and one-liners to answer)

Q: When would you use git stash vs. committing to a WIP branch?
A: Use stash for short-term, experimental interruption; create a WIP branch when the changes are important, need sharing, or long-lived.

Q: What’s the difference between git stash apply and pop?
A: apply leaves the stash; pop removes it if apply succeeds.

Q: How to rename a branch both locally and on remote?
A: git branch -m old new && git push origin -u new && git push origin --delete old

Q: What happens to untracked files with git stash?
A: Not stashed by default — use git stash push -u to include them.
